# Info
This is a docker container setup for [EnhancedMap](https://github.com/andreakarasho/EnhancedMap)

# Instructions
Just go into the directory you cloned it into and run `docker-compose up --build -d` and it will build it and start it up for you.

If this is your first time setting it up, check inside the data directory for `admin_login.txt`.

With that user, you can then connect to your EnhancedMap server!
